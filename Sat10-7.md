Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. 
Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees.

Example:

a = [-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180]

-1 = trees
```js
function sortByHeight(a) {
    var arr1 = [];
    var arr2 = [];
    a.forEach(function(x, index){
      if (x !== -1) {
        arr1.push(x);
      }
    });
    
    a.forEach(function(e, eIndex){
      if (e !== -1) {
        var small = Math.min(...arr1);
        arr2.push(small)
        arr1.splice(arr1.indexOf(small), 1);
        console.log(arr1);
      }else{
        arr2.push(e);
      }
    });
    return arr2;
    
}
```
