Each cell in the matrix contains an integer that represents the price of the room. 
Some rooms are free (their cost is 0), but that's probably because they are haunted, 
so all the bots are afraid of them. That is why any room that is free or is located 
anywhere below a free room in the same column is not considered suitable for the bots 
to live in.

Calculate the total price of all the rooms.

matrix = [
  [0, 1, 1, 2], 
  [0, 5, 0, 0], 
  [2, 0, 3, 3]]

```js
function matrixElementsSum(matrix) {
    var sum = 0;
    var matrixCopy = matrix.slice();
    matrixCopy.forEach(function(x, index){
        x.forEach(function(e, eIndex){
            if (index < matrixCopy.length - 1){
                if (e === 0){
                    matrixCopy[index + 1][eIndex] = 0;
                }
            }
          sum += e;
        })            
    })
    return sum;
}
```
